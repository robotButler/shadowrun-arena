Tasks remaining:
- Fix wound calculation in initiative order
- Fix attackers targetting running defenders don't get -2 dice pool penalty for their attack roll
- The running and sprint conditions are not being reset when moving to the next character
- Highlight cover cells adjacent to the current character if they are in a path to an opposing character
- Move the weapon stats card to above the Movement card
- Fix the initiative phase arrow disappearing when moving to the next character
- Implement range penalties for ranged weapons
- If a character has a ranged weapon, show a line from their position to all opposing characters in range
  - The line should be a different color based on the weapon's range modifier
  - The line should be gray if it intersects any Full Cover cells
  - When a player selects FireRangedWeapon, the targets should be limited by whether the line to them intersects any Full Cover cells
  - If the character has no legitimate ranged targets, the FireRangedWeapon action should be disabled
